# Vaultaire Development Progress

## Current Status: Step 34 of 500 ✅

### Architecture Decisions (CRITICAL - MAINTAIN THESE!)

#### The "Trojan Horse" Strategy
- **Public Face:** Simple S3-compatible storage (like MinIO)
- **Hidden Reality:** AI-native universal data engine
- **Why:** No competition, easy adoption, secret moat

#### Terminology Mapping
| External (S3 API) | Internal (Engine) | Purpose |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Bucket | Container | Ready for compute/ML workloads |
| Object | Artifact | Any data type (blob/wasm/model) |
| Storage | Engine | Universal data operations |
| Backend | Driver | Pluggable architecture |

### Completed Steps (1-34)

#### Foundation (Steps 1-20) ✅
- Git repository initialized
- Go module: `github.com/FairForge/vaultaire`
- HTTP server with gorilla/mux
- Health, metrics, version endpoints
- Structured logging with zap
- Event collection for ML training

#### Architecture (Steps 21-30) ✅
- Engine package (NOT storage!)
- Container/Artifact types (NOT Bucket/Object!)
- Driver interface for backends
- Local filesystem driver
- Config system
- Middleware pipeline

#### S3 Compatibility (Steps 31-34) ✅
- S3 request parser
- S3 operation detection
- XML error responses
- Request ID generation
- CORS support ready

### What's Working

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","uptime":X,"version":"0.1.0"}

# S3 endpoint (returns NotImplemented XML error)
curl http://localhost:8080/mybucket/test.jpg
# Returns: S3 XML error

# Metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
# Returns: Prometheus metrics
Hidden Capabilities (Implemented but Dormant)

WASM Execution: Execute() method ready (returns error)
SQL Queries: Query() method ready (returns error)
ML Operations: Train() and Predict() ready (returns error)
Event Logging: Collecting all access patterns for future ML

Next Steps (35-40): S3 GET Implementation
Goal: Make the server actually retrieve and serve files

 Step 35: Create S3 operations handler
 Step 36: Stream files from engine
 Step 37: Add response headers
 Step 38: Handle range requests
 Step 39: Add ETag support
 Step 40: HEAD operation

Key Files to Review

internal/engine/engine.go - Core engine implementation
internal/api/s3.go - S3 request handling
internal/api/s3_errors.go - XML error responses
internal/drivers/local.go - Local filesystem driver

Environment Setup
bash# Build
go build -o bin/vaultaire ./cmd/vaultaire

# Run
./bin/vaultaire

# Test directory
mkdir -p /tmp/vaultaire/mybucket
Remember the Vision
Short Term: S3-compatible storage at $3.99/TB
Medium Term: "Stripe for Storage" - one API, many backends
Long Term: AI-powered universal data platform
Critical Reminders

ALWAYS use Container/Artifact internally
NEVER expose WASM/ML capabilities yet
MAINTAIN S3 compatibility externally
COLLECT events for future ML training
THINK "engine" not "storage"
