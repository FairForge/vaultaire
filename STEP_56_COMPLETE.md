# Step 56: S3 Storage Operations ✅

## What Was Built
- Core S3 PUT/GET operations with full test coverage
- Multi-tenant isolation via context propagation
- Integration with engine and storage drivers
- Proper error handling and S3-compatible error responses

## Key Learnings
1. **Multi-tenancy requires context**: Every operation needs tenant context for isolation
2. **Engine needs drivers**: Storage operations require registered backend drivers
3. **Test setup matters**: Proper test infrastructure (temp dirs, mock components) is crucial
4. **Authentication layers**: Anonymous access for testing, full auth for production

## Test Results
=== RUN   TestS3_PutAndGet_WithTenant
--- PASS: TestS3_PutAndGet_WithTenant (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestS3_RequiresTenant
--- PASS: TestS3_RequiresTenant (0.00s)
PASS

## Code Quality Checks
- ✅ Tests written first (TDD)
- ✅ Error handling with wrapping
- ✅ Structured logging in adapters
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps
- Implement DELETE operation
- Add HEAD operation for metadata
- Implement LIST operations
- Add multipart upload support
