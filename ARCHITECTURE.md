# Vaultaire Architecture - The Trojan Horse Strategy

## Public Story ðŸŽ­
"We're building a simple MinIO/Ceph alternative"
- S3-compatible API
- Multiple storage backends
- $3.99/TB pricing
- Open source

## Hidden Reality ðŸ§ 
"We're building the Stripe for Storage with AI superpowers"
- Universal data engine (not just storage)
- WASM compute ready
- ML/AI operations ready
- SQL query engine ready
- Event collection for ML training active

## The Genius Move
Every S3 request is secretly training our ML model for:
- Intelligent caching
- Predictive prefetching
- Automatic tiering
- Cost optimization

## Current Implementation Status
- âœ… Dual architecture (S3 external, Engine internal)
- âœ… Event logging active
- âœ… Hidden methods stubbed
- âœ… Container/Artifact types ready
- ðŸ”„ S3 GET being implemented (Steps 35-40)

## Remember
- They think we're building storage
- We're actually building the future of data
- 2 years ahead when we reveal
