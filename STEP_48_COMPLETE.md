# Step 48 COMPLETE - Rate Limiting Implementation

## What Was Built
✅ Rate limiter with token bucket algorithm
✅ Per-tenant isolation
✅ Memory bounds protection (10K limit)
✅ Thread-safe with RWMutex
✅ All tests passing

## Files Created/Modified
- `internal/api/ratelimit.go` - Implementation
- `internal/api/ratelimit_test.go` - Tests
- `internal/logger/logger.go` - Simple logger
- `Makefile` - Added test targets
- `.golangci.yml` - Linter configuration

## TDD Success Story
```yaml
Test 1: Constructor - PASSED
Test 2: Allow Method - PASSED  
Test 3: Memory Bounds - PASSED
Coverage: Working (needs HTTP middleware for higher %)
Technical Implementation

Token bucket: 100 requests/second
Burst capacity: 200 requests
Memory protection: Auto-cleanup at 10K tenants
Using golang.org/x/time/rate package

Next Steps (Step 49-50)

Add HTTP middleware wrapper
Add Prometheus metrics
Integration tests
Connect to main server

Commands That Work
bashmake test-step48      # Run rate limiter tests
make test            # Run all tests
make build           # Build binary
go test -cover       # Check coverage
What Future You Needs to Know

Rate limiter is complete and tested
Memory protection prevents DoS
Ready for HTTP integration
Follows Vaultaire patterns (Engine/Container)
Professional TDD approach used

Business Value

Prevents abuse ($$ saved)
Protects infrastructure
Per-customer limits ready
Enterprise-grade implementation
