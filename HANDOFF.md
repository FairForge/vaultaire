# Vaultaire Development Handoff

## Last Updated: August 14, 2025 - End of Day

## Current Progress: Step 46/500 (10% COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰)

### What's Working:
- âœ… S3 GET operation (Step 33)
- âœ… S3 PUT operation (Step 34) 
- âœ… S3 DELETE operation (Step 35)
- âœ… S3 LIST operation (Step 46)
- âœ… GitHub Enterprise CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… Branch protection + security scanning
- âœ… Project board tracking all 500 steps
- âœ… Dependabot security updates
- âœ… Issue templates

### Today's Achievements:
1. Reached 10% completion milestone!
2. Set up full GitHub Enterprise workflow
3. Tested Seagate Lyve Cloud performance
4. Validated $1,499/month customer opportunity

### Lyve Cloud Performance Discovery:
- US-CENTRAL-2: 1.3s/10MB (BEST - use as primary!)
- US-EAST-1: 2.1s/10MB (good backup)
- US-WEST-1: 3.5-8.5s/10MB (avoid - too slow)
- Solution: Lyve + CloudFlare CDN = meets Reddit customer needs

### Business Validation:
- Found Reddit post: AI company needs S3 storage
- They have $1-2k/month budget
- Our solution: $1,499/month (75% cheaper than AWS!)
- Profit margin: $1,239/month per customer

## Next Session Setup:

### Step 47: Multi-tenancy Middleware
Implement tenant isolation for multiple customers.

### Quick Start:
```bash
cd ~/fairforge/vaultaire
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/step-47-multi-tenancy
code .
Files to Create/Modify:

 internal/api/middleware.go (new file)
 internal/api/auth.go (update validation)
 internal/api/server.go (add middleware chain)

Test Command:
bash# Test with tenant header
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: customer1" http://localhost:8080/test/file.txt
Environment Status:

MacBook Pro M1 (local development)
VSCode configured
Go 1.21 installed
AWS CLI configured with Lyve credentials
3 test buckets in Lyve Cloud ready

Architecture Reminders:

Using 'engine' package (NOT 'storage')
Using 'Container' (NOT 'Bucket') internally
Using 'Artifact' (NOT 'Object') internally
External API remains S3-compatible

Learning Focus for Next Session:

Middleware patterns in Go
Context propagation
Tenant isolation strategies
Request authentication flow

Motivational Stats:

Days coding: 3
Steps completed: 46
Percentage done: 10%
Potential revenue identified: $1,499/month
Time to first customer: ~60 days

## GitHub Enterprise Workflow (REQUIRED):
- âœ… Branch protection enabled on main
- âœ… All changes require PR
- âœ… CI must pass before merge
- âœ… Cannot push directly to main

## Standard workflow:
git checkout -b feat/step-XX
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin feat/step-XX
# Create PR, wait for CI, merge
git checkout main && git pull

Remember: Every step forward is progress. The Reddit customer is waiting!
