Current Chat: Step 44 Context Setup

## Last Completed
- Created context preservation system
- CONTEXT.md tracking architecture decisions
- CHECKLIST.md with implementation rules

## Currently Working On
Setting up tracking system for Steps 45-50

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Implement S3 DELETE (Step 45)
2. Implement S3 LIST (Step 46)
3. Add multi-tenancy middleware (Step 47)
4. Add metrics collection (Step 48)

## Critical Patterns to Maintain
- ✅ Engine pattern (not storage)
- ✅ Container/Artifact naming
- ✅ Event logging active
- ⚠️ Need to add context.Context to all functions
- ⚠️ Need to add tenant isolation

## Code State
- S3 GET: Working at internal/api/s3_handler.go
- S3 PUT: Working at internal/api/s3_handler.go  
- S3 DELETE: Not implemented yet
- S3 LIST: Not implemented yet

## Command to Continue
```bash
cd ~/fairforge/vaultaire
# Next: Implement S3 DELETE in s3_handler.go
